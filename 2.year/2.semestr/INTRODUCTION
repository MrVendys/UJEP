## What is API
 - API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.
 - Example: 
When you use an application on your phone, the application connects to the Internet and sends data to a server. The server then processes the data and sends it back to your phone. 
The application on your phone then interprets the data and presents it to you in a readable way.
